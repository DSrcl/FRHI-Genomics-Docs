Any profession or business, including healthcare, is primarily constituted of intentional and occasionally non-intentional actions, performed and recorded by responsible actors. An Act-instance is a record of such an action.\r\n\n                        Acts connect to Entities in their Roles through Participations and connect to other Acts through ActRelationships. Participations are the authors, performers and other responsible parties as well as subjects and beneficiaries (which includes tools and material used in the performance of the act, which are also subjects). The moodCode distinguishes between Acts that are meant as factual records, vs. records of intended or ordered services, and the other modalities in which act can appear.\r\n\n                        One of the Participations that all acts have (at least implicitly) is a primary author, who is responsible of the Act and who \"owns\" the act. Responsibility for the act means responsibility for what is being stated in the Act and as what it is stated. Ownership of the act is assumed in the sense of who may operationally modify the same act. Ownership and responsibility of the Act is not the same as ownership or responsibility of what the Act-object refers to in the real world. The same real world activity can be described by two people, each being the author of their Act, describing the same real world activity. Yet one can be a witness while the other can be a principal performer. The performer has responsibilities for the physical actions; the witness only has responsibility for making a true statement to the best of his or her ability. The two Act-instances may even disagree, but because each is properly attributed to its author, such disagreements can exist side by side and left to arbitration by a recipient of these Act-instances.\r\n\n                        In this sense, an Act-instance represents a \"statement\" according to Rector and Nowlan (1991) [Foundations for an electronic medical record. Methods Inf Med. 30.]  Rector and Nowlan have emphasized the importance of understanding the medical record not as a collection of facts, but \"a faithful record of what clinicians have heard, seen, thought, and done.\" Rector and Nowlan go on saying that \"the other requirements for a medical record, e.g., that it be attributable and permanent, follow naturally from this view.\" Indeed the Act class is this attributable statement, and the rules of updating acts (discussed in the state-transition model, see Act.statusCode) versus generating new Act-instances are designed according to this principle of permanent attributable statements.\r\n\n                        Rector and Nolan focus on the electronic medical record as a collection of statements, while attributed statements, these are still mostly factual statements. However, the Act class goes beyond this limitation to attributed factual statements, representing what is known as \"speech-acts\" in linguistics and philosophy.  The notion of speech-act includes that there is pragmatic meaning in language utterances, aside from just factual statements; and that these utterances interact with the real world to change the state of affairs, even directly cause physical activities to happen. For example, an order is a speech act that (provided it is issued adequately) will cause the ordered action to be physically performed. The speech act theory has culminated in the seminal work by Austin (1962) [How to do things with words. Oxford University Press].\r\n\n                        An activity in the real world may progress from defined, through planned and ordered to executed, which is represented as the mood of the Act. Even though one might think of a single activity as progressing from planned to executed, this progression is reflected by multiple Act-instances, each having one and only one mood that will not change along the Act-instance life cycle.  This is because the attribution and content of speech acts along this progression of an activity may be different, and it is often critical that a permanent and faithful record be maintained of this progression. The specification of orders or promises or plans must not be overwritten by the specification of what was actually done, so as to allow comparing actions with their earlier specifications. Act-instances that describe this progression of the same real world activity are linked through the ActRelationships (of the relationship category \"sequel\").\r\n\n                        Act as statements or speech-acts are the only representation of real world facts or processes in the HL7 RIM. The truth about the real world is constructed through a combination (and arbitration) of such attributed statements only, and there is no class in the RIM whose objects represent \"objective state of affairs\" or \"real processes\" independent from attributed statements. As such, there is no distinction between an activity and its documentation. Every Act includes both to varying degrees. For example, a factual statement made about recent (but past) activities, authored (and signed) by the performer of such activities, is commonly known as a procedure report or original documentation (e.g., surgical procedure report, clinic note etc.). Conversely, a status update on an activity that is presently in progress, authored by the performer (or a close observer) is considered to capture that activity (and is later superceded by a full procedure report). However, both status update and procedure report are acts of the same kind, only distinguished by mood and state (see statusCode) and completeness of the information.";

His GP does not realize that the patient has, 20 years previously (while at college) had severe alcohol addiction problems, and now, although this is completely under control, his liver has suffered significantly, leaving him more sensitive to hepatic toxicity from paracetamol use.  Later that year, the patient returns with a noticeable level of jaundice.  Paracetamol is immediately withdrawn and alternative solutions for the knee pain are sought.  The jaundice gradually subsides with conservative management, but referral to the gastroenterologist is required for advice and monitoring. \r\n\n                              \n                                 \n                                    There is a substance administration with an associated exposure.

The GP can find nothing particularly amiss, and presumes it is post operative surgical pain that will resolve.  The patient returns a fortnight later, when the GP prescribes further analgesia, but does decide to request an outpatient surgical follow-up appointment.  At this post-surgical outpatient review, the registrar decides to order an ultrasound, which, when performed three weeks later, shows a small faint inexplicable mass.  A laparoscopy is then performed, as a day case procedure, and a piece of a surgical swab is removed from the patient's abdominal cavity.  Thankfully, a full recovery then takes place. \r\n\n                              \n                                 \n                                    This is a procedural sequelae.

His GP does not realize that the patient has, 20 years previously (while at college) had severe alcohol addiction problems, and now, although this is completely under control, his liver has suffered significantly, leaving him more sensitive to hepatic toxicity from paracetamol use.  Later that year, the patient returns with a noticeable level of jaundice.  Paracetamol is immediately withdrawn and alternative solutions for the knee pain are sought.  The jaundice gradually subsides with conservative management, but referral to the gastroenterologist is required for advice and monitoring. \r\n\n                              \n                                 \n                                    There is a substance administration with an associated exposure.

The GP can find nothing particularly amiss, and presumes it is post operative surgical pain that will resolve.  The patient returns a fortnight later, when the GP prescribes further analgesia, but does decide to request an outpatient surgical follow-up appointment.  At this post-surgical outpatient review, the registrar decides to order an ultrasound, which, when performed three weeks later, shows a small faint inexplicable mass.  A laparoscopy is then performed, as a day case procedure, and a piece of a surgical swab is removed from the patient's abdominal cavity.  Thankfully, a full recovery then takes place. \r\n\n                              \n                                 \n                                    This is a procedural sequelae.

SBADM states that the criterion is the presence of a performer-but there are examples above that call this criterion into question (e.g., the first one, concerning a dosing error).".

The overall white blood cell count Observation itself may therefore not have a value by itself (even though it could have one, e.g., the sum total of white blood cells).

Note: The vulnerability of personally identifiable sensitive information may be based on concerns that the unauthorized disclosure may result in social stigmatization or discrimination.) Description:  Types of Sensitivity policy that apply to Acts or Roles.  A sensitivity policy is adopted by an enterprise or group of enterprises (a 'policy domain') through a formal data use agreement that stipulates the value, importance, and vulnerability of information. A sensitivity code representing a sensitivity policy may be associated with criteria such as categories of information or sets of information identifiers (e.g., a value set of clinical codes or branch in a code system hierarchy).   These criteria may in turn be used for the Policy Decision Point in a Security Engine.  A sensitivity code may be used to set the confidentiality code used on information about Acts and Roles to trigger the security mechanisms required to control how security principals (i.e., a person, a machine, a software application) may act on the information (e.g., collection, access, use, or disclosure). Sensitivity codes are never assigned to the transport or business envelope containing patient specific information being exchanged outside of a policy domain as this would disclose the information intended to be protected by the policy.  When sensitive information is exchanged with others outside of a policy domain, the confidentiality code on the transport or business envelope conveys the receiver's responsibilities and indicates the how the information is to be safeguarded without unauthorized disclosure of the sensitive information.  This ensures that sensitive information is treated by receivers as the sender intends, accomplishing interoperability without point to point negotiations.\r\n\n                        \n                           Usage Note: Sensitivity codes are not useful for interoperability outside of a policy domain because sensitivity policies are typically localized and vary drastically across policy domains even for the same information category because of differing organizational business rules, security policies, and jurisdictional requirements.  For example, an employee's sensitivity code would make little sense for use outside of a policy domain.   'Taboo' would rarely be useful outside of a policy domain unless there are jurisdictional requirements requiring that a provider disclose sensitive information to a patient directly.  Sensitivity codes may be more appropriate in a legacy system's Master Files in order to notify those who access a patient's orders and observations about the sensitivity policies that apply.  Newer systems may have a security engine that uses a sensitivity policy's criteria directly.  The specializable InformationSensitivityPolicy Act.code may be useful in some scenarios if used in combination with a sensitivity identifier and/or Act.title.";

The federal standards do not conceptually define ethnicity, and they recognize the absence of an anthropological or scientific basis for ethnicity classification.  Instead, the federal standards acknowledge that ethnicity is a social-political construct in which an individual's own identification with a particular ethnicity is preferred to observer identification.  The standards specify two minimum ethnicity categories: Hispanic or Latino, and Not Hispanic or Latino.  The standards define a Hispanic or Latino as a person of \"Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, South or Central America, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race.\" The standards stipulate that ethnicity data need not be limited to the two minimum categories, but any expansion must be collapsible to those categories.

The specializable Sensitivity Act.code may be useful in some scenarious if used in combination with a sensitivity identifier and/or Act.title. (OID = 2.16.840.1.113883.1.11.20428)";

The federal standards do not conceptually define race, and they recognize the absence of an anthropological or scientific basis for racial classification.  Instead, the federal standards acknowledge that race is a social-political construct in which an individual's own identification with one more race categories is preferred to observer identification. The standards use a variety of features to define five minimum race categories. Among these features are descent from \"the original peoples\" of a specified region or nation.  The minimum race categories are American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White.  The federal standards stipulate that race data need not be limited to the five minimum categories, but any expansion must be collapsible to those categories.";
