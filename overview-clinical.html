<p>
FHIR (Fast Health Interoperability Resources) is designed to enable the exchange of healthcare-related information.
This includes clinical data as well as healthcare-related administration, public health and research.  It covers
both human and veterinary medicine and is intended to be useable world-wide in a wide variety of contexts - in-patient,
long-term care, community care, allied health, etc.
</p>

<p>
FHIR is a specification targeted to those who write software and architect interoperable solutions.
That's who must actually create the systems that will use FHIR.  The FHIR specification does not attempt to
define good or best clinical practice, nor does it provide guidance on user interfaces or workflows.  Guidance
in these areas may be useful but is outside FHIR's scope.
</p>
<p>
Because of FHIR's implementation focus, many aspects of this specification deal with the technical underpinings of the
exchange of clinical information between electronic systems.  This section provides an introduction to 
what FHIR provides and tries to highlight the portions of the specification
that are likely to be of most interest to the clinical community and skipping over some of the technical
drudgery of interoperability.  However, if technical drudgery is your thing, feel free to dig right in
wherever you wish.
</p>

<h3><span class="sectioncount">1.8.2.1<a name="1.8.2.1"> </a></span> Resources <a href="overview-clinical.html#1.8.2.1" title="link to here" class="self-link"><img src="target.png"/></a></h3>
<p>
From a clinical perspective, the important part of the FHIR specification to understand is the resources.
Think of resources as &quot;forms&quot; reflecting different types of clinical and administrative information that can
be captured and shared.
The FHIR specification defines a generic &quot;form template&quot; for each type of clinical information - so one for
allergies, one for prescriptions, one for referrals, etc.
</p>
<p>
FHIR data consists of repositories of completed forms - resource instances.  The resource instances will describe patient information
(demographics, health conditions, procedures, etc.) as well as administrative information
(practitioners, organizations, locations).  Some resources are infrastructure components used to 
support the technical exchange of information - describing what systems can do, defining allowed sets
of codes, etc.  FHIR repositories might be elecronic health record (EHR) systems, pharmacy systems,
hospital information systems (HISs), etc.  Some systems, such as clinical decision support engines, may
expose FHIR interfaces even though they don't actually store any information.
</p>

<h3><span class="sectioncount">1.8.2.2<a name="1.8.2.2"> </a></span> Building useful Clinical Systems out of Molecules <a href="overview-clinical.html#1.8.2.2" title="link to here" class="self-link"><img src="target.png"/></a></h3>
<p>
Each resource contains a small amount of highly-focused data. A single resource doesn't say much, but a lot of very small resources 
together create a useful clinical record. Information systems map the actions that a user takes (look up patient records, make a
note in their history, etc) to operations on the relevant resources.
</p>
<p>
The resources link to each other, and the links create a network (or web) of information that represent a health record (or at least, 
a useful part of it).  For example, a prescription resource instance
might reference the practitioner who created the prescription, the patient the prescription is for and the medication being
prescribed.  Each of these are maintained in their own folders in their own cabinets.  However, the FHIR interface allows
all of these links to be resolved and the relevant pieces of paper to be assembled to present a complete picture to the end user.
</p>

<h3><span class="sectioncount">1.8.2.3<a name="1.8.2.3"> </a></span> Extensibility and Profiling <a href="overview-clinical.html#1.8.2.3" title="link to here" class="self-link"><img src="target.png"/></a></h3>
<p>
The forms in FHIR are generic.  They have to be useable in different countries, by different types of clinicians
in different contexts (human care, veterinary care, public health, research, etc).  FHIR recognizes that
one size fits all is not appropriate in a healthcare space, so it provides the ability to adjust the
forms to be able to handle the needs of different implementation spaces - adding additional &quot;extensions&quot;
as well as enforcing constraints.  For example, a &quot;prescription&quot; form might have extension elements
added to support tracking of restricted medications while also constraining what codes can be used
to communicate types of drugs to a particular national standard.  However, the forms are designed in such
a way that these changes can be made without changing how systems pass forms around.  Thus any system can
consume completed forms even if they have &quot;extra&quot; elements added - and even if those particular extra elements
aren't used by the receiving system.
</p>
<p>
To keep the base forms that everyone uses from being overly complex, FHIR has a rule that, in most cases, a
resource will only include data elements if there's an expectation that most implementations will use that particular
data element.  That doesn't mean the data must always exist.  For example, most systems in the world are capable
of tracking &quot;deceased date&quot; for patient, even though that element will be blank for many patient records.  On
the other hand, not so many systems track hair color, so hair color would be omitted from the base form and those
systems that need it (perhaps in some esoteric clinical research setting?) would be able to use extensions to
capture it if needed.
</p>
<p>
To keep the number of resources reasonable, some of them are fairly broad.  The <a href="observation.html">Observation</a>
resource is used for vital signs, lab results, psychological assessments and a variety of other things.  To set rules
for more narrow areas (e.g. &quot;What should I send if I want to share a blood pressure?&quot;), FHIR allows the creation of
profiles.  There will be a great deal of clinical work involved in forming consensus around how different types of
detailed clinical information should be captured and shared in particular settings.  Tooling to support the creation
of profiles directly by clinicians is part of the plan for FHIR, but is still in the very early stages.
</p>

<h3><span class="sectioncount">1.8.2.4<a name="1.8.2.4"> </a></span> Narrative <a href="overview-clinical.html#1.8.2.4" title="link to here" class="self-link"><img src="target.png"/></a></h3>
<p>
FHIR is intended as a system for sharing discrete data between healthcare systems in a manner that supports
computer interoperability - decision support, rules triggering, trend analysis, etc.  However, not every system is
the same and not all systems will recognize all discrete data.  As well, there is still considerable value in data exchange
in circumstances where very little of that data is captured in a discrete manner.  For this reason, FHIR resources
support sharing not only discrete information for computation but also a human-readable view so that the humans
on each end of a healthcare information exchange can still get a full picture of what's going on.
</p>
<p>
Narrative is expected to exist for most resource instances, though it can be omitted in a few limited circumstances.
In some cases the narrative will be generated from discrete information.  For example the narrative for a patient
might look like this:
</p>
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
<b><u>Peter James Chalmers (OFFICIAL), Jim</u></b><br/>
<b>identifier</b>: MRN = 12345 (USUAL)<br/>
<b>telecom</b>: ph: (03) 5555 6473(WORK)<br/>
<b>gender</b>: MALE<br/>
<b>birthDate</b>: Dec 25, 1974<br/>
<b>deceased</b>: false<br/>
<b>address</b>: 534 Erewhon St PleasantVille Vic 3999 (HOME)
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
In other cases, the narrative might be generated directly by a practitioner.  Examples might include
referral letters, pathology reports, etc.  Certain pieces of the narrative would later be exposed as
discrete data.
</p>

<h3><span class="sectioncount">1.8.2.5<a name="1.8.2.5"> </a></span> Interfaces <a href="overview-clinical.html#1.8.2.5" title="link to here" class="self-link"><img src="target.png"/></a></h3>
<p>
In addition to defining the &quot;forms&quot; for data exchange (resources), FHIR also defines a set of interfaces by 
which systems actually share that information .  There are four primary mechanisms
or &quot;paradigms&quot; of exchange supported by FHIR: REST, Documents, Messaging and Services.
</p>

<h4><span class="sectioncount">1.8.2.5.1<a name="1.8.2.5.1"> </a></span> REST <a href="overview-clinical.html#1.8.2.5.1" title="link to here" class="self-link"><img src="target.png"/></a></h4>
<p>
REST is the simplest exchange mechanism.  Continuing the &quot;form&quot; metaphor, a RESTful server can be thought
of as a room full of filing cabinets.  Within the room is a cabinet for each &quot;type&quot; of form it supports.  The cabinet contains
folders where each folder has a unique number and represents one particular real-world thing - one patient, one encounter
one medication, etc.  Each folder (resource instance) contains multiple pieces of paper, where each piece of paper represents a &quot;version&quot;
of that real world thing.  Every time someone updates a record, a new piece of paper is added to the top that
file folder.  To see the history of a resource, you just flip through the pieces of paper in the folder.
</p>
<p>
Now picture a clerk at the front door of that room.  You can pass the clerk a requisition to have them do something with
the information in those file cabinets.  The &quot;clerk&quot; and set of requisition forms make up the FHIR restful API.  With that API,
you can do the following things:
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>search</i>: Search through the folders for ones that meet a set of search criteria</li>
<li><i>read</i>: Get a copy of one a specific folder in one of the cabinets</li>
<li><i>create</i>: Add a new folder to the appropriate cabinet (with a new number)</li>
<li><i>update</i>: Add a new page (version) to the contents of a specific folder</li>
<li><i>delete</i>: Remove a folder from the cabinet (or more accurately, put a sticker on it saying &quot;do not open&quot;)</li>
<li><i>history</i>: Look at all the pages in a single folder (or in some cases a particular file cabinet or even the whole room - though that's more for technical purposes than clinical purposes)</li>
<li><i>transaction</i>: Give the server a bunch of folders all at once to update</li>
</ul>
<p>
EHR and other systems may present a more sophisticated interface to their end users, but behind the scenes, they are all
making the same sort of requisitions to the same file clerk.
</p>

<h4><span class="sectioncount">1.8.2.5.2<a name="1.8.2.5.2"> </a></span> Documents <a href="overview-clinical.html#1.8.2.5.2" title="link to here" class="self-link"><img src="target.png"/></a></h4>
<p>
Documents are a familiar mechanism for sharing information in the healthcare space.  They are useful whenever
there's a desire to guide how a consumer of information will navigate it and there's a need to have a &quot;frozen&quot; view
of information that can be reliably retrieved even years in the future.  Examples of document-like things in
healthcare include discharge summaries and lab reports.
</p>
<p>
In FHIR, there's a special resource called <a href="composition.html">Composition</a> that acts as the &quot;cover page&quot;
for a document.  It identifies the title, author date, relevant patient and the table of contents.  A FHIR document
can be thought of as a set of sheets (resource instances) stacked together with a title page on top that is stapled
together.  That stapled collection can then be stored or passed around, conveying a whole set of information at
once.
</p>

<h4><span class="sectioncount">1.8.2.5.3<a name="1.8.2.5.3"> </a></span> Messaging <a href="overview-clinical.html#1.8.2.5.3" title="link to here" class="self-link"><img src="target.png"/></a></h4>
<p>
Much healthcare information exchange happens using a messaging paradigm.  In messaging, a collection of information is sent
from one system to another with an explicit request to &quot;do something&quot;.  A message might request that a lab order be
fulfilled or that two patient records be merged or notify a system that a patient has been transferred from one bed to
another.  Messaging is similar to documents in that it collects resources together.  However, in this case, the
cover page is a <a href="messageheader.html">MessageHeader</a> that acts as a requisition.  And rather than a staple, the
resources are joined together with a paper-clip.  There's no expectation that the receiving system will store the
data exactly as received.
</p>

<h4><span class="sectioncount">1.8.2.5.4<a name="1.8.2.5.4"> </a></span> Services <a href="overview-clinical.html#1.8.2.5.4" title="link to here" class="self-link"><img src="target.png"/></a></h4>
<p>
Services can be thought of as a light-weight way of doing messaging.  Rather than a full cover page, a small sticky
note is attached to the front of a resource.  And sometimes rather than sending a full piece of paper, the relevant
pieces are cut out and sent as fragments.  The response to a requisition is a similarly paper-clipped bundle of resource
instances.  Services are likely to be used for things like decision support.  E.g. &quot;Is there a problem with prescribing medication
X for patient Y?&quot;, &quot;What's the recommended care plan for a patient with conditions A, B and C?&quot;
</p>

<h3><span class="sectioncount">1.8.2.6<a name="1.8.2.6"> </a></span> Approaching the specification <a href="overview-clinical.html#1.8.2.6" title="link to here" class="self-link"><img src="target.png"/></a></h3>
<p>
A FHIR-based system's capabilities are defined by what the resources can say. From a clinical perspective, then, these things define the clinical record:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the kinds of resources that are defined</li>
  <li>their data contents, rules about the data including what terminology codes</li>
  <li>how they link to each other</li>
  <li>how you can search for information</li>
</ul>
<p>
This information can all be found in the resource definition pages.  The resources most likely to be of interest can be
found on the <a href="clinical.html">Clinical</a> and <a href="administration.html">Administrative</a> pages.  Instructions
on how to interpret the information found on the resource pages can be found <a href="formats.html">here</a>.  The
<i>Logical table</i> or <i>UML</i> views are likely to be easiest to understand.  Also, don't forget to look at the examples
tab for an idea of what kind of information can be expressed.  Seeing how elements are used to convey real data is often more
useful than just looking at definitions.  Also, look at the Profiles tab to see examples of how different resources can be
constrained for use in particular contexts.
</p>
<p>
Clinician and other domain expertise and feedback is always welcome as we continue refining the FHIR specification.  At the top
of each resource page is a link to the home page for the work group responsible for that particular resource.  If you have feedback
on resource design, consider getting involved.
