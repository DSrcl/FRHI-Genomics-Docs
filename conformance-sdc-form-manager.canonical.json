Servers may choose to not support deletions and instead require that the form's status be changed to 'retired'.  Other systems support deletions but limit them to forms meeting certain requirements.  E.g. only forms with a status of draft or only forms that have been retired for at least two years, etc.</p>\n                  </td>\n               </tr>\n            </tbody>\n         </table>\n         <h4>Search</h4>\n         <p>Supported Includes: Questionnaire.group.question.options</p>\n         <table class=\"list\">\n            <thead>\n               <tr>\n                  <th>Parameter</th>\n                  <th>Conformance</th>\n                  <th>Type</th>\n                  <th>Definition &amp;
